              Manesar: To encourage fore- ign automakers to test their ve•
              hicles in India, the Centre has decided to remove import duty on
              automobiles brought in for testing at its agencies such as
              International Center for Auto- motive Technology (iCAT) and
              Automotive Research Associa- tionof India (ARAI). Foreign
              automakers have to pay a high import duty of 252% on the vehicles
              they bring into the coun for testing. Minister for heavy
              industries Mahendra Nath Pandey on Sa- turday said the move will
              make vehicle testing competitive and will support the
              developmentof a testing hub in India.

                  TPCIL, India's sole nuclear I N power plant operator, on
                  Wednesday received an allo- cation of Rs 9,410 crore in the
                  Union Budget for 2023-24 as it sets out to ramp up atomic
                  power generation capacity in the country. The allocation to
                  the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) was an
                  increase of Rs 2,859 crore (more than 43 per cent) over the
                  revised estimate of Rs 6,551 crore of the current fiscal. In
                  addition to the bud- getary allocation, the NPCIL will raise.

                Energy has been allocated Rs 25,078.49 crore which is lower than
                Rs 25,965.67 crore it had received in the revised esti- mates in
                the 2022-23 fiscal. The other public sector companies under the
                Department of Atomic Energy - Indian Rare Earths Ltd will get Rs
                120.30 crore. The Fuel Recycle Projects under the Nuclear
                Regulatory Board have been allocated Rs 805.21 crore. It
                concerns construction of Integrated Nuclear Recycle Project to
                improve supply of fuel to second stage of the nuclear power
                programme. India's current installed nuclear power capacity is
                6,780 MW and it plans to add 21 more atomic power generating
                units with a total installed capacity of 15,700 MW by 2031. Most
                nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium
                in a once-through fuel cycle. Fuel is removed when the
                percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes more atomic power
                generating units with a total so large that a chain reaction can
                no longer be sustained, typically three years. It is then cooled
                for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being
                transferred to long term storage. The spent fuel, though low in
                volume, is high-level radioactive waste.

          Innovation, which is advancement over an exist- ing product or idea,
          is a prerequisite for continuous improvement. But a disruptive
          innovation shakes up an industry once in a while. Disruptive
          innovation in busi- ness is not a new concept. It took birth in 1995
          when it was by one of the world's thinkers on innovation Christensen
          along with his co-authors. However, over the years, this concept has
          been misun- derstood. It has generally been misapplied to a situation
          where the industry norms are shaken up and existing play- ers stirred.
          And here's where the catch is. Originally, Christensen ideated the
          con- cept of disruption, more like a David and Goliath situa-

          tion— a smaller company with fewer resources successfully challenging
          an established business. Established businesses in their effort to
          retain their existin majority target cus- tomer tase, focus mainly on
          improving their present prod- ucts or services and largely ignore
          other market seg- ments. New entrants that sense this gap provide
          prod- ucts or services lucrative to the overlooked segments. While the
          established businesses do not pay heed to these new entrants, they
          slow- ly make inroads into upmar- ket, providing the same prod- ucts
          or services to the major- ity customers whilst retaining their earlier
          advantage—lower prices. Once these main- stream customers embrace

          the new products or services, in large quantities, one can say
          disruption has occurred. According to Christensen, potential for
          disruptive inno- vations arise because estab- lished businesses ignore
          both low-end and new markets. In an attempt to be more prof- itable,
          established businesses concentrate on providing mainstream customers
          with high quality products and ser- vices and commit resources in
          upgrading, enhancing and perfecting their existing prod- ucts and
          services, all the while ignoring the low-end market. Sensing this
          opportunity, new entrants foray into this gap by using a low-cost
          business model. A low-end disruptor snatches the market share in this

          ket. Additionally, disruption can occur by creating new markets where
          none existed, by developing new products for consumers, at a lower
          price and an acceptable quality. Arrival of personal computers, and
          later smartphones are ect examples of new-mar- et disruption. The
          first computers, known as mainframes, were huge and very expensive.
          With costs as high as $2 million and size as big as to fill an entire
          room, computing tech- nology was out ot bounds for the common man.
          With the invention of the personal computer, a small and afford- able
          piece of machine, a new market segment of individu- als was created.
          Over the years, with con- tinuous improvement in its
        </div>
        <div class="bottom-section">
          capabilities, a humble person- al computer made the main- frame
          computers virtually obsolete. 'Ihe next step in new market disruption
          is the emer- gence of smartphones, which are creating disruptions at
          two levels. One, the ability to use the internet in a phone at a
          fraction of cost of a personal computer is making usage of personal
          computers less nec- essary. Two, smartphone pho- tograph taking
          capabilities are set to disrupt the digital pho- tography industry.
          However, over the years, the above concept has been misused by many
          who have not given a serious thought about the notion itself.
          Internationally, Uber has been touted as a disruption. It uses mobile
          applications .

          with drivers who are willing to provide them. Founded in 2009, the
          company has enjoyed fantastic growth and is still expanding. It has
          report- ed tremendous financial suc- cess, with funding rounds and
          soaring valuation. No doubt, Uber has transformed the business of
          transportation. But has it brought about disruption? For disruption to
          happen, a company has to target an overlooked cus- tomer base, provide
          a right fit of product or service, usual- ly at a lower cost. Uber
          con- nected the end users, i.e., cus- tomers used to taking cab ser-
          vices, to service providers. So, Uber did not fulfil any of the two
          conditions to become a disrupter — firstly, it did not bring the
          market segment.
